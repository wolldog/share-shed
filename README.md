# Share Shed
Share Shed is a website that enables people to make their tools available to hire. So many of us have purchased tools to complete a DIY project and then these tools sit in the shed for months on end without being used. Share Shed allows users to advertise their tools for hire or make use of other users tools for a small daily fee.
